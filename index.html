        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
        
        The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) is located in Laoag City, 
        with an external campus in Paoay, Ilocos Norte. It was chosen in 1983 as 
        one of the 21 public technological institutes in the Technical Vocational 
        Education Project (TVEP) of the then Department of Education, Culture, and Sports 
        (DECS) mandated to produce the needed manpower for industrial growth and development 
        in the country.
        <br><br>
        The college was an accredited regional trade skills training and testing center in Region 1 
        by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and a regional training 
        center in ceramic by the Product Design and Development Center of the Philippines.
        <br><br>
        It also hosts a Toyota Technology Center (TTC), one among 18 established in nominated 
        partner schools in the country under the Toyota Automotive Education Program (TAEP) 
        of the Toyota Motor Philippines Foundation (TMPF) Inc., which is envisioned to become 
        the regional skills development center in automotive servicing.
        <br><br>
        The University is Deputized by CHED to implement the Expanded Tertiary Education 
        Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) with the BS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY as one 
        of the ETEEAP Degree Programs offered by the College. The ETEEAP is a comprehensive 
        educational assessment program at the tertiary level that recognizes, accredits, and 
        gives equivalencies to knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values gained by individuals 
        from relevant work. This program recognizes that education and the acquisition of higher 
        expertise also take place beyond the confines of the classroom. The BSIT degree may be 
        granted to individuals through the recognition of their knowledge and skills gained from 
        non-formal or informal learning. The recognition of the knowledge and skills are done 
        through equivalency and assessment by assessors of the College.
